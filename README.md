# HWG Client Scheduler

The **HWG Client Scheduler** is a custom-built web application designed to help front desk staff and schedulers easily book client appointments based on staff availability.

This project began as a personal learning exercise to teach myself how to build and connect a **frontend** and **backend** system â€” and get them communicating effectively. Along the way, I explored how to structure a full-stack app, manage state, route data between components, and handle scheduling logic.

## ğŸ§  Purpose

This mini project simulates a real-world scheduling workflow used in therapy and medical offices. The app allows staff to:

- View real-time staff availability
- Book, modify, and manage client appointments
- Assign rooms and services per session
- Mark no-shows and cancellations visually

- **Vite** â€“ Fast development server & bundler
- **React** (in early prototype work or alternative views)
- **FullCalendar / React-Big-Calendar** â€“ Interactive calendar UI
- **Bootswatch** â€“ Bootstrap-based UI theming
- **Axios** â€“ For API communication
- **Flask / Express / PHP** (depending on backend stage) â€“ Server-side backend to handle API and database
- **MySQL / SQLite** â€“ Database for appointment and therapist data
- **Node.js** â€“ Backend runtime environment (when using Express)

> This project started with Vue but also explored React and other tech to compare approaches and expand learning.
